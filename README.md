# Able
Able is a modified transport system for disabled people. 
With Able, disabled people are transported with comfort such that there's less or no nuisance to them.


## Inside Story
Speaking to a challenged individual - a local, of course - who uses crutches for walking. He had an accident for which he was required to cut off the both limbs. The narration goes as the person faced challenges when trying to access public transport. In some cases, there were struggles where he couldn't struggle to get the transport service. In another scene, there would be denial since the care they need wouldn't be very much comfortable to accomodate them. 

In another scene, it would be difficult for the disabled to cross some roads. the disabled interviewed had a second accident when crossing the road.

**Able** focuses to provide solution to most of the transport challenges faced by these people.
Able uses local transport a three-wheeled vehicle, so-called "Bajaji". The Bajaji is designed to have foldable spaces for disabled using wheel chairs. The far-end has a fixed chair for people using crutches and other kinds of disabled. The entry has a ramp or rail to support boarding the bajaji.

Below are some of the pictures displaying the designed prototype. (it's not that neat & clear though).
